## About Me

I am an HTML coder and a beginner front-end developer. I do (specialize in) web page layout for static sites, landing pages, layout for CMS with subsequent landing, and I also do HTML layout of e-mail letters.

I love beautiful and lightweight websites with a clean and minimalistic design, smart and responsive JS animation, created in compliance with the rules of semantic layout.

I appreciate thoughtful and user-friendly sites, with good UX design, sites that are useful for users.
