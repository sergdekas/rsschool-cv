### About Me

I am an HTML coder and a junior front-end developer. I do (specialize at the moment) web page layout for static sites, landing pages, layout for CMS with further integration, and I also do HTML layout of e-mails.

I love beautiful and lightweight websites with a clean and minimalistic design, smart and responsive JS animation, created in compliance with the rules of semantic layout.

I appreciate well-thought-out and user-friendly sites, with good UX design, sites that are useful for users.
